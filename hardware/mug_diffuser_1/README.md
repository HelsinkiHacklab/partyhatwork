# Diffuser for 2 leds based on a plastic mug

## BOM

  * Orthex juomamuki 4dl, EAN: 6411760154911. This particular mug is likely only available in Finland (At least Prisma carries it)
  * Thin aluminium sheet with smooth surface, 155mmx160mm minimum. Bauhaus & K-rauta have these small & thin sheets in various sizes and finishes.

## Instructions

  1. Print the [template](./reflector_template.svg)
  2. Attach it to your alu sheet (glue is ok)
  3. Use tin snips to cut out the two shapes, you can ignore the two small notches
  4. Make a 90-degree bend on the line indicated by the notches. To save yourself the trouble of 
     detaching the template paper, make it so that the paper sides go back-to-back when you have two reflectors.

If you have some sort of CNC that can cut thin metal sheets you can use the [DXF-file](./reflector.dxf).
