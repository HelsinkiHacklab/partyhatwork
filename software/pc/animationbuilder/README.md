# Helper to make & test animations

Basic idea is to have checkboxes for the mode flags and simple text inputs (R,G,B,Duration) for defining each frame. 
Color picker for the RGB-values a bonus.

A preview mode that will simulate the animation and a button that will generate ready-to-use Arduino code for the animation.
