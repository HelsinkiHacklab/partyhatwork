## partyhatwork

This is the reference implementation of a PartyHatWork node. It implements only the base protocol, if you wish
to extend the protocol or redefine behaviours do not change this sketch but create a new copy. Variants that are deemed
common/good/crazy enough can be added here as separate sketches.
