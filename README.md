============

Mesh network of party-hats, see http://kirjoitusalusta.fi/hacklab-partyhatwork

The current board is designed to be a "shield" to the Xmega32A4U 
breakout board from https://github.com/HelsinkiHacklab/XMega-boards 

Essential pins are pre-connected to modules and drivers (probably one full port 
will have transistor-array for driving leds), rest of the spare pins (both XMega
and XBee) will be brought out to IDC connectors for further use.
